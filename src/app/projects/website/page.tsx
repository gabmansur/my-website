        I've wanted to put together some kind of portfolio for years. At some point I had a prototype which honestly was overly polished, minimalistic site that was basically just an extension of my CV. Looking back, it says a lot about how much I‚Äôve evolved, not just in my work but in fully embracing who I am and being unapologetically me. 
        < br/>
        < br/>
        That's why the goal of this website is to be not just a collection of things I've done professionally, but a space that feels alive, a reflection of my approach to technology and existencial matters.
        I wanted something functional yet chaotic, structured yet unhinged, something that lives and breathes. Maybe a very extension of me in the digital realm?
        This site is inspired by the early 00s internet era, when UX was but an afterthought and browsing felt like exploring something raw and forbidden.
        Think deep web forums, 4chan boards, command-line terminals, places where information was messy, but alive.

        - Next.js + React ‚Äì the brain of the operation. Component-based, server-side rendered, and fast enough to keep up with my chaos < br/>
        - Tailwind CSS ‚Äì because writing vanilla CSS is a personal attack < br/>
        - Vercel ‚Äì instant deployments, edge functions, and serverless magic. Tbf I'm just too lazy to set up manual CI/CD. < br/>
        - TypeScript ‚Äì because catching bugs before they happen is one of humanity's greatest achievements < br/>
        - Framer Motion ‚Äì for smooth animations and just enough unnecessary movement  < br/>
        - Custom Easter Eggs & CLI Elements ‚Äì hidden surprises, terminal-like interactions and other random things I'll probably forget about  < br/>

        <p className="mt-2 text-green-300">
          - Going forward, I would like to share resources such as books, ideas and experiences that helped shaped my path, but also just the everyday stuff like sports and games I'm into. < br/>
          - Adding more interactive elements, possibly a terminal-like command system.  < br/>
          - Creating more ridiculous 90s/early 00s UI choices just for fun.  < br/>
          - Maybe adding a chatbot version of me? But only if it's sarcastic.< br/>
